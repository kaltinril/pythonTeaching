Rock Paper Scissors

This will be a player vs computer game

Rules of the game:
 1. Each player picks rock, paper, or scissors at the same time (Without knowing the other persons answer)
 2. Rock beats Scissors (Smashes)
 3. Scissors beats Paper (Cuts)
 4. Paper beats Rock (Covers)
 5. Go for the best of 2 out of 3 games.  (Meaning, if you get a tie, the third game winner is the tie breaker)

Details and explanation on steps:
 1. Create a variable called turns_left, set the value to 3
 2. Create a loop, that exits if turns_left is 0
 3. Ask the player for their answer
    Suggest using R for Rock, P for Paper, and S for scissors.
        "Pick [R]ock, [P]aper, or [S]cissors: "
 4. Computer player: Get a random number between 1 and 3
    Suggest using 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for scissors
 5. Check the situations/Rules and print if the computer won, or the player won.


Recall the following python language information:

### To create a random number, you must import the library called random at the top of your file like this:
import random 

### To get a random number, you use the following line which in this example, gets a number between 1 and 100
result = random.randint(1, 100)

### To get input from the user, use the input command to print a message and get input at the same time
answer = input("My fancy message: ")

### To Create a loop, use the while loop
while my_variable > 0:
    # my code goes here, indented

### To compare two values, and do something based on the result, use an IF statement
if var_one > 5:
    print("My message!")

if var_one = 0:
    print("My Message!!")

if var_one > var_two:
    print("My Message!")
