Hidden Message Part 1

In this assignment you will alter part1 to create your own mapping/translation functions and learn about dictionaries.

A dictionary is essentially just a key:value pair list, similar to JSON.


Items Learned:
 1. Functions (creating, arguments, return values))

 2. Dictionaries


Assignment:
 1. Take part 1 and with using dictionaries, do your own mapping translation


Requirements:
 1. Must use a dictionary

 2. Must not use any of these:
        maketrans
        translate

 3. Message should be "encrypted" and "decrypted" without errors.


Lesson on Dictionaries:

# Create a dictionary
city_to_state = {'Anchorage':'Alaska','Seattle','Washington','San Fransisco':'California'}

# Access a entry in the dictionary
state = city_to_state['Anchorage']
print(state) # Alaska

# Add an item to a dictionary after creation
city_to_state['Concord'] = 'New Hampshire'

# Remove an item from a dictionary
result = city_to_state.pop('Anchorage')

# Getting the length of the dictionary
num_of_entries = len(city_to_state)
print(num_of_entries)

TIPS:
 1. Play around with dictionaries
