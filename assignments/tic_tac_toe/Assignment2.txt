Tic Tac Toe

Make Tic Tac Toe.

Rules:
 1. Board is a 3x3 grid
	[ ][ ][ ]
	[ ][ ][ ]
	[ ][ ][ ]
 2. Two players, each get a unique symbol (X or O)
 3. Each player takes turns placing their one of their symbol on the board
	(Suggest using number key for 3x3 grid)
 4. Pick a player to go first 
 5. To win:
	Get 3 in a row, 3 in a column, or 3 in a diagonal
 6. Tie:
	if all squares are filled, and no one has won


Optional additions:
 7. Let players chose how many games to play before they start (3 games, 10 games, etc)
 8. Keep track of how many wins for each player
 9. Use Arrays to store the placement of the X and O
 10. Make the grid arbitrary NxN, where the win condition still requires N in a row
	i.e. 4x4, where you have to get 4 in a row
	Good luck figuring out a mechanism for user input to decide which square to place it in :p
 11. Allow user to pick they're symbol
 12. Allow more than 2 players in boards larger than 4x4.

Extra Optional features:
 13. Use Pygame library and draw the board instead of using text
 14. Use pygame library to use mouse click instead of keyboard input
 15. Add in a time counter that gives points for the lowest time, change a WIN to a # of points.
