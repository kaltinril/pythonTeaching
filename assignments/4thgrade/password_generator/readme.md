# Password Generator (Live programming exercise)
This class time we made a program live from the students input.

We decided to make a random letter generator.  They figured out we could use the random numbers, and just substitute or "map" numbers to letters and print the result.

Then we decided to make a random password generator from this by looping 8 times.

Finaly we decided we needed the password on a single line, so we combined the letters into a single string and print that.  

We did not complete this, so this is left as an exercise for the students to complete.
