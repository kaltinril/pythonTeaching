Wack-a-mole

Game Board:
 1. a 3x3 grid (9 total places)
 2. A "mole" will randomly appear in one of the 9 places
 3. The mole will stay on the screen for a short random time

Rules:
 1. The player must press the number keys (1-9) preferably on the number pad to "wack" the mole.
 2. Give the player 30 seconds to wack as many moles as they can.  Ensure that only 30 moles total spawn so as to be a fair chance for total
 3. If the player wacks a mole, give them 10 points
 4. If the player wacks an empty hole, subtract 5 points

Information:
 * Players can take turns seeing who can get the most points

New Python Features:

    ## How to measure how long it has been
    # Import the time library
    import time

    # Store the time you create or "spawn" the mole
    spawn_time = time.time()

    # Check if it's been so many seconds or fractions of a second since then
    if (time.time() - spawn_time) > 0.5: # half a second
        do_something_here()

Help on how to do this:

If you need help, read below

1. Create a new file, safe it as wackamole.py
2. Import the time library at the top
3. Create variables to store the points
4. Create variables to store how many moles have appeared
5. Create variable to store the start time of the game, so you can count down to 30
6. Create a variable called is_running and set it to true
7. Create a while loop, using the is_running variable to keep the loop going
8. Check to see if you should spawn a mole. (has it passed 1 second since you last spawned one? if so, spawn a new one for a random time)
9. Check if the player pressed anything, if they hit the mole, give them 10 points, if they didn't, subtract 5
10. If 30 seconds are up, or if the person hit all 30 moles, game over!
