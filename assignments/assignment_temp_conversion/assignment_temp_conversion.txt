Temperature Conversion

Items learned:
 1. Function creation
 2. Function arguments
 3. Function return values

Create a Temperature Conversion program.  
 1. This program will ask the user for what they want to convert from and to.  
 2. It will then call the appropriate function
 3. It will print out the results for the user to see.
 4. The program will loop until the user presses Q, allowing them to pick a new conversion.

Create the following functions.  
 1. celsius_to_fahrenheit
 2. fahrenheit_to_celsius
 3. celsius_to_kelvin
 4. kelvin_to_celsius
 5. fahrenheit_to_kelvin
 6. kelvin_to_fahrenheit

Each function should take in the first value, and return the second value.  For instance, celsius_to_fahrenheit should take in the C value, and return the F value

Equations:
 1. C to F: Divide by 5, then multiply by 9, then add 32
 2. F to C: Deduct 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9
 3. C to K: add 273.15
 4. K to C: subtract 273.15
 5. F to K: Deduct 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9, add 273.15
 6. K to F: Deduct 273.15, Divide by 5, then multiply by 9, then add 32

TIPS:
For F->K:
 - simply call your F->C, and send that answer to C->K
For K->F:
 - simply call your K->C, and send that answer to C->F
